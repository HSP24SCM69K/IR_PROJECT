    "intro": "Helium is a super light gas which can make your vocal cords vibrate at a much faster rate, producing a high-pitched tone. You can inhale helium directly from a balloon for a few seconds and then say something funny to enjoy the effects! Just make sure to use caution and stop immediately if you get lightheaded or dizzy—when you breathe in helium you aren’t getting oxygen, so take frequent breaks to breathe normally.",
