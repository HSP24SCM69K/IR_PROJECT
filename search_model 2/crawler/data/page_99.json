Just like when athletes experience a type of \"runner's high\" after a race, so too does completing any goal produce a sense of elation and pride. This article explores many ways of setting and pursuing goals. Goals won't just complete themselves. You need to be regimented in your pursuit of them. Get started. Keep going. Achieve your aspirations.",

It is far easier if you have a teacher — someone who knows the “formulas” to success — to help you along the way, to explain ways of overcoming obstacles, and to celebrate with once you’ve succeeded. A good mentor will be just as proud of you for achieving your goal as you’ll be of yourself."
