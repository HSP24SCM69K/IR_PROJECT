    "intro": "Visualization is a motivational technique which can help you achieve personal goals. If you really want something to come to fruition, then you have to put your imaginative mind to work. See the result in front of you, play the game you are going to play in your mind, or watch yourself accepting your degree at college. The only limit is your own mind. Visualization is also a useful mental skill which allows you to picture an image or scenario not immediately in front of your eyes.",
