    "intro": "The quality of your sleep is just as important as the quantity. Getting the right number of hours every night is unlikely to benefit you if you are frequently waking up, if you sleep at wildly different times, or if you sleep shallowly. Alcohol, caffeine, light, noise, and worry can all interfere with the quality of your sleep. To get quality rest, you'll want to improve your sleep hygiene â€” different practices and habits that ensure you get the most our of your sleep, such as setting a sleep schedule that works with your body's natural rhythms. Eliminate stressors and distractions, and establish a comforting bedtime routine.",
