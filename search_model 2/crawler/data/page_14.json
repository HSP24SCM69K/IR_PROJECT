    "intro": "If youâ€™ve ever wanted to get a laugh out of people, you can try to whip them with the end of a towel. If you roll up your towel before you whip them, it will make an even bigger impact. When snapping a towel on other people, it's important that you know they are a good sport and won't get angry with you. Once you find a suitable target and know the right technique, snapping a towel is easy.",
