    "intro": "Real Butterfly knives are very dangerous. However, messing around with fake knives can be a lot of fun. Flipping the knife open is a fun test of dexterity and skill that can improve your hand eye coordination. Again, make sure you use a fake knife - they are  legal and the blade is not sharp or pointy at all which completely eliminates the risk. If you need to learn how to flip a fake Butterfly knife for a role in a film or you just want to learn for fun, it isnâ€™t too difficult.",

Flip the knife up in the exact same way but open your thumb and move it to the side this time. This will allow the handle of the dangerous side to smack into the handle that you are holding, engaging the knife. ",
