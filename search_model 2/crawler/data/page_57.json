    "intro": "Have people called you a wet blanket, a stick in the mud, or a drag? Do you feel like you just don’t know how to make a social situation more entertaining? If this sounds like you, then don’t worry—all you have to do is work on being more agreeable around other people, be open to poking some fun at yourself, and to get ready for the next adventure. If you make a real effort, then people will go from thinking you’re a drag to calling you the life of the party.",
