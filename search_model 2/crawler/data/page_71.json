    "intro": "We make dozens of decisions every single day. What to wear, what to eat, which route to take to work, which movie to watch on Netflix – all of these are fairly simple and straightforward choices that will typically be determined by mood or preference. Other decisions, such as which college major to select or whether to move out of the country, may be more difficult to make. You may be so worried about making the wrong choice that you experience analysis paralysis, and you delay making any choice at all. Learn a step-by-step decision-making process that helps you move smoothly through making even the toughest choices.",
